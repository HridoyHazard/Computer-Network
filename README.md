## Course Summary
Computer Network Is One Of The Major Course of CSE. You'll Get This Course In 3nd Year.In This Course You'll Learn the concepts of networking in the protocol stack to design and implement a local area network. It explores the architecture, components, functions, protocols, and applications of the Internet and computer networks. Students learn how various network protocols run concurrently and interoperate together in the protocol stack to enable the transfer of data in the Internet.

## Lab 
you'll get some lab packet file in this repo, you'll learn how to build a network and send data among these network, protocl design, simulation of data transfer in network and more... before checking these packet file i strongly suggests you to try yourself first and then check these if you can't solve...

## Installing Necessary Software
- [Cisco Packet Tracker](https://www.computernetworkingnotes.com/ccna-study-guide/download-packet-tracer-for-windows-and-linux.html)


## How To Build Network
